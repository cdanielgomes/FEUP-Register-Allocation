###SUMMARY:

Register allocation is an important stage of compilers. It is responsible to allocate internal microprocessor registers for scalar variables in a software program. As the number of registers may not be enough to store, e.g., all the scalar variables in a function, some of those variables may have to be stored in memory (something that a compiler wants to avoid because of the overhead imposed by the memory access latencies). Register allocation considers that multiple variables might be allocated to the same register, the removal of move instructions, and cost models in order to select the variables to be stored in memory if needed.

This program implements part of a graph coloring based algorithm to do register allocation. The program was developed for teaching purposes in the context of a Compilers course and intends to show how a very important and widely used register allocation approach works. Chaitin et al. [CA+81][Chai82] have been the first to abstract the register allocation problem as a graph coloring problem and in their approach prosed the use of the Kempeâ€™s algorithm [Kem79] for finding a K-coloring of a graph. The algorithm is based on the approach of [GA96], which extended the Chaitin et al. approach, e.g., by proposing an iterative register coalescing scheme. We note that the algorithm presented here only performs one iteration of the register allocation algorithm as it does not consider the necessity of additional runs of the algorithm whenever spilling needs to be done.

The implementation considers as input the interference graph as a DOT file (that can be output by liveness analysis) and the number of registers (or the set of registers) available.

For coalescing, the program allows users to select between two different heuristics: Briggs et al. [BCT94] or George et al. [GA96].

For spilling, the program used the degree of the nodes or a manual selection of the nodes to spill.
